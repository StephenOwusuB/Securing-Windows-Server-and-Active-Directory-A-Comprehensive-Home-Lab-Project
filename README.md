<p align="center">
<b>The first thing I am going to do is create a Microsoft Azure account, this will be the cloud environment I'll use to provision my resources. I will take advantage of the $200 credit I'll receive to do this project. The resources I'm using are not very resource heavy, so my credit can be used towards future projects. In addition, I signed up to Pulsedive for free. </b> <br/>
